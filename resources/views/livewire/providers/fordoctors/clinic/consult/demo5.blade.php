            <summary class="font-md">Are online consultations legal?</summary>
            <p class="font-normal font-sm">As per MCI guidelines, there are no restrictions on consulting with a patient
                online.<br />Today,
                patients and doctors
                interact with each other digitally over various mediums. GLH offers a secure, encrypted platform for
                doctors to
                connect with patients online. It allows patients and doctors to interact at their own convenience,
                although, we do
                recommend patients to not consult online for emergency cases..</p>
